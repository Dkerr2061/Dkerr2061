        <summary><h3>👨🏻‍🚒 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
        <p>For nine years, I worked as a firefighter, where I learned how to be an effective part of a team. Every member had a specific role, and people depended on my contribution, trusting that I would get the job done. Whether it was rope rescues, confined space rescues, or extractions, every call was different, and I had to adapt quickly to the task in front of me. Problem-solving was critical—I broke down complex challenges into smaller components, ensuring each piece was executed correctly to solve the bigger problem successfully. That experience also taught me that failure is an essential part of learning. Instead of being discouraged, I treated failures as opportunities to grow and excel.</p>

<p>When I transitioned into software engineering, I carried those lessons with me. I started with JavaScript, building simple games like rock-paper-scissors on the DOM, and quickly realized how much more there was to explore. I expanded my skills, learning React to create dynamic user interfaces and Python to handle back-end development. I embraced Flask for building RESTful APIs and used SQLAlchemy to manage databases effectively.
As I grew, I added TypeScript to ensure my code was robust and began working with MySQL to write efficient queries, deepening my understanding of relational databases. What started as small websites evolved into full-scale applications, where I could design and implement both the front and back end, creating scalable and functional systems.</p>
       
<p>Now, I’m continuing to build on that foundation by expanding my toolkit to include frameworks like Astro, diving deeper into SEO strategies, and perfecting my ability to create reactive and responsive designs. My journey has been one of continuous learning, applying problem-solving skills to new challenges, and constantly striving to build impactful and reliable applications.</p>
